# How to optimize?

There are several ways you can optimize a Node.js application to improve its performance and scalability. Here are a few examples:

- Use a performance monitoring tool to identify areas of your application that are slow or inefficient. This might include a tool like New Relic, which can track the performance of your application in real-time and provide insights into which parts of the code are causing performance issues.

- Use caching to store frequently-used data in memory, so that it can be accessed quickly without having to hit the database or other slow storage systems. This might include a tool like Redis or Memcached, which can store data in a key-value store and enable your application to retrieve it quickly.

- Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of your application. This might include a tool like Nginx, which can route requests to the appropriate instance based on the URL or other criteria.

- Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets, such as images and JavaScript files, from a network of edge servers located near the user. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the distance that data has to travel, and by offloading the serving of static assets to the CDN.

By following these steps, you can optimize your Node.js application to improve its performance and scalability. It may be helpful to do some additional research and experimentation to determine the best approach for your particular use case.

## New Relic (tool that shows if inefficient or not)

Here is an example of how you could use a performance monitoring tool like New Relic to track the performance of your Node.js application in real-time:

const newrelic = require('newrelic');

```js
// Enable New Relic to monitor the performance of your application
newrelic.instrument(() => {
  // Start the application
  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Application listening on port 3000");
  });
});
```

In this example, the newrelic module is used to enable New Relic to monitor the performance of your application. The newrelic.instrument() method is called, which instruments your application code and allows New Relic to track its performance.

Once New Relic is enabled, it will collect performance data from your application in real-time, and provide insights into which parts of the code are causing performance issues. You can then use this information to identify and fix performance bottlenecks in your application.

This approach allows you to use a performance monitoring tool like New Relic to track the performance of your Node.js application in real-time, and identify areas for optimization. It may be helpful to do some additional research and experimentation to determine the best approach for your particular use case.

## Serve static files

Here is an example of how you could use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets in a Node.js application:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use the express.static middleware to serve static files from a directory
app.use("/static", express.static("public"));

// Use the CDN to serve static files
app.use("/static", express.static("https://my-cdn.com/static"));

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Application listening on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, the express.static() middleware is used to serve static files from a directory on the server, as well as from a CDN. The app.use() method is used to specify the URL path where the static files will be served, and the express.static() middleware is used to specify the directory or CDN where the files are located.

This approach allows you to use a CDN to serve static assets, such as images and JavaScript files, from a network of edge servers located near the user. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the distance that data has to travel, and by offloading the serving of static assets to the CDN. It may be helpful to do some additional research and experimentation to determine the best approach for your particular use case.
